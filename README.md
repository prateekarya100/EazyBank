<h1>EazyBank - Banking Microservices Application 💳🏦</h1>


EazyBank is a robust and scalable microservices-based banking application built using modern technologies like Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Spring Security, and Docker. 
It demonstrates a secure and efficient backend system that leverages REST APIs for communication and provides seamless integration with various services. 
The application is designed to handle a wide range of banking operations and is fully containerized using Docker for easy deployment and portability.

Key Features ✨
Microservices Architecture: The application is designed using a microservices architecture, where different components (e.g., user management, transaction handling) are decoupled into independent services. 
Each service is responsible for a specific functionality, making the application scalable and maintainable. 🔧

Java 8: The application is built using Java 8, leveraging its powerful features like lambda expressions, streams, and the Date-Time API for modern, efficient, and readable code. ☕️

Spring Data JPA: Used for data access and manipulation, Spring Data JPA provides a powerful abstraction over JPA (Java Persistence API). It simplifies database operations and integrates seamlessly with Spring-based applications for persistent storage. 📦

REST APIs: The backend exposes RESTful APIs that are used to interact with the system. These APIs allow external clients to interact with the services in a standardized way. 🌐

Spring Security: Security is a top priority in this application. Spring Security is used to ensure that all sensitive data is protected. It handles user authentication and authorization for different banking services and API access. 🔒

Spring Cloud: The application leverages Spring Cloud for cloud-native features such as service discovery, configuration management, and fault tolerance. It makes the system highly resilient and easily deployable to cloud environments. ☁️

Swagger API Documentation: The project uses Swagger to provide an interactive and user-friendly interface for API documentation. It allows developers to easily explore and test the available APIs. 📖

Postman Testing: Postman is used for testing the API endpoints. It ensures that all the APIs are functional and meet the required standards. 🧪

Hookdeck: Hookdeck is integrated to manage webhook services, allowing the system to efficiently process asynchronous events and notifications in real-time. 🔄

Docker & Containerization: The entire application is containerized using Docker. This allows the services to run in isolated environments, ensuring consistency and ease of deployment across various platforms. 🐳

Microservices: Each module of the application is a self-contained microservice that communicates via RESTful APIs. 🧩

Technologies Used 🛠️
Spring Boot: Simplifies the development of production-grade Spring-based applications. Used to develop the core backend services. 🚀

Spring Cloud: Provides cloud-native features like service discovery and configuration management, enhancing scalability and fault tolerance. 🌩️

Spring Security: Handles authentication and authorization, ensuring that all sensitive data and resources are protected. 🔑

Swagger API: Provides a powerful interface for documenting and testing the REST APIs. It allows developers to interact with the APIs in a convenient way. 📑

Postman: Used for testing and validating the API endpoints to ensure they meet the required functionality. 📬

Microservices: Each module of the application is a self-contained microservice that communicates via RESTful APIs. 🧩

Hookdeck: Integrates webhook handling into the system, allowing for efficient processing of external events. ⚡

Docker: Containerizes the application, ensuring that all services are deployed in isolated and consistent environments. 🐳

Containerization: The application and its services are fully containerized, allowing for easy deployment on any system that supports Docker. 📦
